    <p>
      If you’re a fan of garlic bread and Butter Burgers, try out this delicious
      recipe which is a mashup of the two. The burgers themselves have garlic
      butter inside which melts as the burger cooks, soaking through the meat
      and keeping it super moist. A touch of garlic butter is added on top of
      each burger too, so it can coat the surface before getting topped with
      cheese. As a final flourish, the brioche buns are spread with garlic
      butter then grilled for a crispy garlic bread effect.

      <li>4 slices American cheese</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather your ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Crush garlic and then cook it in 2 tablespoons butter in a small pan
        over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes. This is just to remove the raw
        flavor of the garlic.
      </li>
      <li>Let cool, then mix it into the remaining butter with parsley.</li>
      <li>
        Set half of garlic butter aside to use for spreading on the buns. Wrap
        remaining butter in a sheet of wax paper, roll it into a log (about 1
        1/4- inch diameter), then place into the freezer to harden completely,
        about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unwrap frozen butter, and slice into at least 8 thin disks. It’s better
        to have more than 8 slices if you can to have a few spares. Return 4
        slices to the freezer to stay firm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill to a medium-high heat, about 400 degrees F (200
        degrees C), then shape the burgers. Divide beef into 4 3-ounce pieces
        and 4 1-ounce pieces. Form the 3-ounce hunks into a patty with a well in
        the center to help contain the butter. Place a frozen disk of garlic
        butter on top of each of the 4 patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the 1-ounce pieces of beef to cover the butter disks, pressing beef
        together firmly to seal butter inside. Season both sides of each patty
        with a pinch of salt and black pepper, then press your thumb into the
        middle of each burger to create a little dip on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill burgers for 3 to 4 minutes on one side then flip over. Top each
        with a disk of garlic butter and, once melted, top with a slice of
        American cheese. Let them cook for 3 to 4 minutes on this side, then
        remove from the grill to a clean tray to rest.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, spread softened garlic butter you set aside earlier over the
        cut sides of burger buns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill buns, cut side down, until lightly toasted, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack burgers into grilled buns with lettuce and tomato and any other
        bits you want. Serve burgers warm.
