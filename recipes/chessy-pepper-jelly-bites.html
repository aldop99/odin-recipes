    <p>
      These cheesy pepper jelly bites are hot, tangy, crisp, and buttery, an
      impressive appetizer that is pretty easy to make.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 sheet puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) block cream cheese, cold</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pepper jelly</li>
      <li>fresh thyme or chopped chives, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and lightly
        grease a 24-cup mini muffin pan with nonstick spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unfold the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface and roll it just
        enough to smooth out the creases. Cut into 24 equal squares (4 across
        and 6 down works perfectly). Press 1 pastry square into each muffin cup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry begins to puff and turn
        lightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut cream cheese into 24 small cubes. Gently press 1 cube into each puff
        pastry cup, then top with about 1 teaspoon of pepper jelly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the pan to the oven; bake until the pastry is golden and the
        cream cheese is warmed through, 8 to 10 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the bites cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes before removing.
        Sprinkle with thyme or chives and serve warm. Enjoy!
